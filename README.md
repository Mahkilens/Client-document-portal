# 📁 Client Document Portal — System Architecture & Development

This repository contains the full planning and development process for a **real-world Client Document Portal** web application.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate system design, UI/UX thinking, and practical front-end development skills through a problem companies face every day: securely exchanging documents with clients.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Businesses constantly deal with:
- Missing documents  
- Clients sending files through email  
- Incorrect or expired paperwork  
- No centralized location to manage uploads
